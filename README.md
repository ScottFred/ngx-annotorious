# NgxAnnotorious

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

This workspace contains a self-contained Angular wrapper for Annotorious V3, plus a couple of Cadmus-related libraries depending on it.

To use the Annotorious wrapper you just need Annotorious, and no other dependency. Cadmus libraries are found in this workspace for practical reasons; but also provide an example for using the library.
