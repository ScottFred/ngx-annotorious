# NgxAnnotorious

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

This workspace contains a self-contained Angular wrapper for Annotorious V3, plus a couple of Cadmus-related libraries depending on it.

To use the Annotorious wrapper you just need Annotorious, and no other dependency. Cadmus libraries are in this workspace for practical reasons, but also provide an example for using the library.

- [Cadmus Image Gallery Brick](./projects/myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery/README.md)
- [IIIF support for Cadmus Image Gallery Brick](./projects/myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery-iiif/README.md)
