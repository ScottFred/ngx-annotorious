  - [ImgAnnotationList](#imgannotationlist)

This library is a minimalist set of components wrapping [Annotorious V3](https://annotorious.dev/) functionalities and used to easily integrate in an application a gallery of images from some online source and an image annotator with a user-defined model, not necessarily limited to the W3C annotation. In the bigger application where this is going to be used, Annotorious is used to select a portion of an image, while the model to be attached to it is user-defined.

## Setup

1. install Annotorious in your Angular app:
   - `npm i @annotorious/annotorious @myrmidon/ngx-annotorious`.
   - in angular.json, add to `styles` the value `"node_modules/@annotorious/annotorious/dist/annotorious.css"`.
2. for this library, in your `app.config`, configure the default **options for Material dialogs**, as annotations metadata are edited inside a popup, e.g.:

```ts
// in appConfig providers array:
{
  provide: MAT_DIALOG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS,
  useValue: {
    hasBackdrop: true,
    maxHeight: '800px',
  },
},
```

## Demo App

In the demo shell workspace hosting this library for development, the homepage uses an image annotator component wrapping some core components:

- a toolbar component for tool selection ([ImgAnnotationToolbar](./projects/myrmidon/ngx-annotorious/src/lib/components/img-annotator-toolbar/img-annotator-toolbar.component.ts));
- an `img` with a simple image loaded from the application assets for demo purposes. This element is decorated with a directive wrapping the Annotorious functionality ([ImgAnnotatorDirective](./projects/myrmidon/ngx-annotorious/src/lib/directives/img-annotator.directive.ts));
- a list of annotations.

## ImgAnnotatorDirective

The core of the library is the lightweight directive [ImgAnnotatorDirective](./projects/myrmidon/ngx-annotorious/src/lib/directives/img-annotator.directive.ts) used to wrap an Annotorious annotator. This takes care of initializing an `ImageAnnotator` instance at the right time in the Angular component lifecycle, configure it as required, wrap its main functions, and and attach listeners to its events to forward them to its Angular consumer.

## ImgAnnotationList

Other components are then provided to ease the usage of this directive in the context of an images gallery.

The core logic for orchestrating events and actions for the wrapped annotator is implemented in a generic `ImgAnnotationList` class. This keeps its own storage of annotations, so that it includes any third-party model, whatever its complexity, attached to the selected portion of an image; and provides a simple API surface to be consumed by other Angular components.

The extended annotation model for this list, `ListAnnotation<T>`, is a wrapper for the Annotorious annotation including an additional payload of type `T`.

This custom model is stored in a parallel storage mantained by the image annotator component. This storage is kept in synch with the `ImageAnnotator` storage by listening to its deletion and selection change events. In the end, on the Angular side only this synched storage is important, because it will hold all the annotations generated by the `ImageAnnotator` wrapped in a larger structure including a payload implementing a specific third-party model.

The annotations list API is:

- properties:
  - `annotations$`: observable of `ListAnnotation<T>[]`.
  - `selectedAnnotation$`: observable of `ListAnnotation<T>` or undefined, representing the currently selected annotation if any.
  - `annotationToString`: a function used to build a string representing a `ListAnnotation<T>`.
  - `image`: the reference `GalleryImage`.
- methods:
  - `getAnnotations()`
  - `clearAnnotations()`
  - `setAnnotations(annotations: ListAnnotation<T>[])`
  - `removeAnnotation(id: string)`
  - `editAnnotation(annotation: ImageAnnotation)`
  - `selectAnnotation(annotation?: ListAnnotation<T>)`
  - `editAnnotationAt(index: number)`
  - `selectAnnotationAt(index: number)`
  - `removeAnnotationAt(index: number)`
- event handlers:
  - `onCreateAnnotation(annotation: ImageAnnotation)`
  - `onSelectionChange(annotation?: ImageAnnotation)`
  - `onDeleteAnnotation(annotation: ImageAnnotation)`
